# Online-Food

This is a frontend-only online food ordering website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project simulates a real-world food delivery platform where users can browse restaurants, view menus, add food items to the cart, and proceed to checkout.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)

JavaScript (ES6) – Interactivity and cart functionality

(Optional: Bootstrap/Tailwind) – If you’re using a CSS framework



How It Works

Users land on the homepage and browse available restaurants or categories.

Selecting a restaurant displays its menu with food details.

Users can add items to the cart and view the updated total.

On checkout, users fill in delivery details (simulation only, no backend).
